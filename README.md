# Purpose of this repository
I've been noticed that some persons struggles on how to deploy a SharpTimer up-to-date version on their servers, so this repository gets all the updated versions (CSS, MetaMod, MovementUnlocker, RampBugFIX, STFixes)  and bundles to a zip folder using GitHub actions.

So, you just need to download the OS you want to run, Windows or Linux and drop to your game/csgo/ folder.

Also, to activate metamod, you need to add the following to gameinfo.gi:
```
Game csgo/addons/metamod
```

For database, better to use something like MySQL. In this repository you can find an SQL file that should work for MySQL 8 to create a template database. _(example.sql)_

Any issues, please ask on SharpTimer discord:
